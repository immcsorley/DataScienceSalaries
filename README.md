# DataScienceSalaries
Using Tableau to visualize a data science salary dataset

## Description
I have been very interested in the world of data science. In this project I used a data set from kaggle and Tableau to visualize different aspects to explore how different variables affect the salaries of data science posisitions.

## Dashboard
I created this dashboard in Tableau to visualize some data. I wanted to work on my Tableau skills as well as learn more about data science careers and job names.

The map shows where our data is from with the darker grey being a higher median salary for that country. 
The graph on the right shows median salary based on the size of the company from M(medium), L(large), S(small)
Lastly, the graph on the top shows the top job titles we have in the data and the median salary from each job title. 

### Analysis
From this quick analysis, we can see that Data Architects and Data Science manager positions seem to be paid the most on average. Company size seems to matter a little bit, but interestingly enough medium sized companies have a higher medium salary than large companies. Finally, Russia and the US have the highest median salary in our dataset with a median around 150k. 

### Next Steps
Next I plan on doing a regression model on this data to see which variables are most correlated with higher salary as well as create a model to predict salaries based on this data.
