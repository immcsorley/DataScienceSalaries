Using Tableau to visualize a data science salary dataset

## Description
I have been very interested in the world of data science. In this project I used a data set from kaggle and Tableau to visualize different aspects to explore how different variables affect the salaries of data science posisitions.

## Dashboard
I created this dashboard in Tableau to visualize some data. I wanted to work on my Tableau skills as well as learn more about data science careers and job names.
